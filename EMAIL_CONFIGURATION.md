# Email Service Configuration Fixed

## Changes Made

### 1. Email Service (`server/utils/emailService.js`)

**Fixed SSL/TLS Configuration:**
- Auto-detects port 465 (SSL) vs 587 (TLS) and configures `secure` flag accordingly
- Port 587 now uses TLS with `requireTLS: true` instead of SSL
- Added proper TLS configuration with minimum version TLSv1.2
- Added connection verification on startup

**Enhanced Retry Logic:**
- Automatic retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff delay (2s, 4s, 6s)
- Better error logging with error codes and attempt tracking
- Clear success/failure messages with messageId tracking

**Environment Detection:**
- Automatically detects development vs production environment
- Adjusts TLS certificate validation based on environment
- Enables debug logging in development mode

**Configuration Validation:**
- Checks if EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are configured on startup
- Verifies SMTP connection on initialization
- Provides clear warnings if email is not configured

### 2. Auth Routes (`server/routes/auth.js`)

**Improved Password Reset Endpoint:**
- Properly handles email service response object (was treating boolean as object)
- Returns detailed error messages to client
- Better logging of success/failure with error details

### 3. Environment Configuration

**Updated `.env` with proper Gmail SMTP settings:**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=caikiet10@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=nqip jcfp xlwz iyme
```

**Updated `.env.example` with documentation:**
- Added comments explaining Gmail App Password requirement
- Documented port options (587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
- Included link to generate Gmail App Password

## Gmail SMTP Configuration

### For Port 587 (TLS) - Recommended:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### For Port 465 (SSL) - Alternative:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

**Important:** You must use a Gmail App Password, not your regular Gmail password.
Generate one at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

## Email Features Supported

All email sending functions now work properly:

1. **Password Reset** (`POST /api/auth/forgot-password`)
   - Sends password reset link with token
   - 10-minute expiration

2. **New Account Credentials**
   - Sends login credentials to new users
   - Includes role and college information

3. **Test Assignment Notifications**
   - Notifies college admins of new test assignments
   - Notifies students when tests are assigned

4. **General Notifications**
   - Supports multiple types (general, urgent, announcement, reminder)
   - Priority levels (low, medium, high)

## Testing the Configuration

The email service verifies the connection on startup. You'll see in the logs:
- `âœ“ Email service connection verified successfully` - Configuration is working
- `[ERROR]` messages - Configuration needs attention

## Error Resolution

The original error was caused by:
- Port 587 (TLS) configured with `secure: true` (which is for SSL on port 465)
- This caused SSL/TLS version mismatch: "wrong version number"

**Fixed by:**
- Auto-detecting port and setting `secure` flag correctly
- Using `requireTLS: true` for port 587
- Adding proper TLS configuration
- Adding connection verification on startup

## Environment Compatibility

The service automatically detects and adapts to:
- **Development (localhost):** Relaxed TLS validation, debug logging enabled
- **Production:** Strict TLS validation, minimal logging

No manual configuration needed - it detects `NODE_ENV` automatically.
