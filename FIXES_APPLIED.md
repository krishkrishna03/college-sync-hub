# Fixes Applied - October 7, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DateTime Display Issue
**Problem**: When creating a test with start time 07/10/2025 10:00 AM and end time 07/10/2025 10:00 PM, it was showing:
- Start Date: Oct 7, 2025, 03:30 PM 
- End Date: Oct 8, 2025, 03:30 AM

**Root Cause**: The datetime was being stored correctly in UTC in MongoDB, but the display formatting was not consistent across components.

**Solution**:
- Updated `formatDate` function in `TestCard.tsx` to properly format dates with 12-hour time format
- Updated `formatDate` function in `StudentDashboard.tsx` to use consistent locale formatting
- Added `hour12: true` option to ensure AM/PM display
- The dates are now correctly displayed in the user's local timezone

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Test/TestCard.tsx`
- `src/pages/dashboards/StudentDashboard.tsx`

### 2. Student Dashboard Not Showing Previous Test Results
**Problem**: The student dashboard's recent activity section was not displaying results from previously completed tests.

**Root Cause**: The code was trying to access `test.attempt.score` which doesn't exist. The correct field is `test.attempt.marksObtained` and `test.attempt.percentage`.

**Solution**:
- Updated the recent activity mapping to use correct field names:
  - Changed `test.attempt.score` to `test.attempt.marksObtained`
  - Changed `test.attempt.submittedAt` to `test.attempt.createdAt`
  - Used `test.attempt.percentage` directly instead of calculating it
- Fixed the testing timeline to display the correct marks and percentage

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/dashboards/StudentDashboard.tsx` (lines 686-793)

### 3. Tests Sidebar with Dropdown
**Problem**: Need to organize test types in the sidebar with a dropdown showing:
- Practice Tests
- Assessment Tests
- Mock Tests
- Company Tests (Specific Company Tests)

**Solution**:
- Added dropdown functionality to the Sidebar component for student role
- Created expandable/collapsible menu with chevron icons
- Added sub-items for each test type:
  - Practice Tests
  - Assessment Tests
  - Mock Tests
  - Company Tests
- Implemented event-based communication between Sidebar and StudentDashboard
- Tests are automatically filtered when clicking on a specific test type in the dropdown
- Used sessionStorage and custom events to synchronize state

**Features**:
- Dropdown opens/closes with smooth animation
- Sub-items are indented with bullet points
- Clicking a sub-item navigates to "My Tests" tab and filters by that test type
- Visual feedback with hover effects

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Added dropdown with sub-items
- `src/pages/dashboards/StudentDashboard.tsx` - Added event listener for test type changes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **DateTime Display**:
   - Create a test with specific start/end times
   - Verify the displayed times match the input times in your local timezone
   - Check that the times are consistent across TestCard and StudentDashboard

2. **Previous Test Results**:
   - Complete a test as a student
   - Navigate to the dashboard
   - Verify the "Recent Exam Activity" section shows the completed test
   - Check that the score and percentage are displayed correctly

3. **Test Dropdown**:
   - Login as a student
   - Click on "Tests" in the sidebar
   - Verify the dropdown expands showing all 4 test types
   - Click on each test type and verify the tests are filtered correctly
   - Verify the dropdown collapses when clicking the main "Tests" button again

## Technical Details

### DateTime Handling
The application now properly handles datetime conversion:
- Backend stores dates in UTC as Date objects in MongoDB
- Frontend converts from UTC to local timezone for display
- datetime-local inputs use local timezone format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM
- All date displays use consistent locale formatting with 12-hour time

### Test Result Fields
The TestAttempt model includes these fields:
- `marksObtained`: Total marks scored by the student
- `percentage`: Calculated percentage score
- `correctAnswers`: Number of correct answers
- `incorrectAnswers`: Number of incorrect answers
- `createdAt`: Timestamp when test was submitted

### Sidebar-Dashboard Communication
The system uses a combination of:
- `sessionStorage`: Temporary storage for test type selection
- Custom Events: `testTypeChanged` event for real-time updates
- React state management: Local state for UI updates
