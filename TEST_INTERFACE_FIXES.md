# Test Interface Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Test Submission Error - timeSpent Validation
**Problem**: Test submission was failing with error: "Path timeSpent is required"
- The server validation required `timeSpent` to be minimum 1 minute
- Quick tests taking less than 60 seconds would fail with value 0

**Solution**:
- Updated validation in `server/routes/tests.js` to accept `timeSpent: 0`
- Changed: `body('timeSpent').isInt({ min: 1 })` → `body('timeSpent').isInt({ min: 0 })`

### 2. Missing Test Interface Buttons
**Problem**: Essential test navigation buttons were missing

**Solution**: Added three key buttons to the test interface:
1. **Save & Next** - Saves current answer and moves to next question
2. **Mark for Review** - Flags questions for later review (toggleable, shown in yellow)
3. **Clear Response** - Clears the selected answer for current question

### 3. Full Screen Test Interface
**Problem**: Test interface was not utilizing full screen space

**Solution**:
- Changed main container from `min-h-screen` to `fixed inset-0` for true fullscreen
- Added `flex flex-col` layout for proper vertical spacing
- Made question content area scrollable with `overflow-y-auto`
- Updated question card to use `h-full flex flex-col` for better layout

## New Features

### Question Status Indicators
Questions are now color-coded in the navigation panel:
- **Blue**: Current question
- **Green**: Answered questions
- **Yellow with border**: Marked for review
- **Gray**: Not answered

### Enhanced Navigation Panel
Added "Review" counter showing how many questions are marked for review:
- Answered (X)
- Not Answered (X)
- Review (X) ← NEW
- Current

### Button Behavior
- **Clear Response**: Only enabled when question has an answer
- **Mark for Review**: Toggles between marked/unmarked state
- **Save & Next**: Moves to next question (disabled on last question)
- Previous/Next buttons maintain practice mode restrictions
