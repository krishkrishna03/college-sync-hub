# Multi-Section Test Feature - Complete Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Multi-Section Panel Not Showing
When creating tests with types "Assessment", "Mock Test", or "Specific Company Test", the system was not showing the multi-section configuration interface.

### 2. Subject Field Shown for All Test Types
Subject field was appearing for all test types. It should only appear for "Practice" tests.

## Root Causes
1. The MasterAdminDashboard was using the wrong test form component (`TestForm` instead of `TestFormWithSections`)
2. Subject field was not conditionally rendered based on test type
3. Backend required subject field for all tests

## Solution

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated MasterAdminDashboard (`/src/pages/dashboards/MasterAdminDashboard.tsx`)
- **Added Import**: Imported `TestFormWithSections` component
- **Updated Modal in Tests Tab**: Changed from `<TestForm>` to `<TestFormWithSections>` (line 664)
- **Updated Modal in Dashboard Tab**: Changed from `<TestForm>` to `<TestFormWithSections>` (line 1378)

#### 2. Updated TestFormWithSections (`/src/components/Test/TestFormWithSections.tsx`)
- **Conditional Subject Field**: Subject dropdown only shows when test type is "Practice"
- **Field Order**: Reorganized to show Test Type before Subject
- **Default Subject**: Sets subject to "Technical" for non-Practice tests
- **Auto-enable Sections**: Automatically enables sections for Assessment/Mock Test/Specific Company Test

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Test Routes (`/server/routes/tests.js`)
- **Made Subject Optional**: Changed subject validation from required to optional

#### 2. Updated Test Model (`/server/models/Test.js`)
- **Made Subject Optional**: Changed `required: true` to `required: false` with `default: null`
- **Maintains Validation**: Subject still validates against allowed values when provided

## How It Works Now

### Creating Practice Tests
1. Master Admin selects Test Type: **"Practice"**
2. **Subject dropdown appears** with options: Verbal, Reasoning, Technical, Arithmetic, Communication
3. Standard single-section test form is shown
4. Configure number of questions, marks, duration

### Creating Assessment/Mock Test/Specific Company Test
1. Master Admin selects Test Type: **"Assessment"**, **"Mock Test"**, or **"Specific Company Test"**
2. **Subject dropdown is HIDDEN** (not needed for multi-section tests)
3. **Multi-Section Configuration Panel Automatically Appears**:
   - Blue highlighted box with message: "This test type requires multiple sections"
   - Section Configuration component is displayed

4. **Configure Sections**:
   - Click "Add Section" to create sections
   - For each section, configure:
     - Section Name (e.g., "Verbal Section", "Technical Section")
     - Section Duration (in minutes)
     - Number of Questions
     - Marks per Question

5. **Add Questions to Each Section**:
   - Click "Add Questions" button on a section
   - Add questions specifically to that section
   - Each section tracks its own questions independently

6. **Overall Test Calculations**:
   - Total Duration = Sum of all section durations
   - Total Questions = Sum of all section question counts
   - Total Marks = Sum of (section questions × section marks)

### Example Flow for Assessment Test:

```
Step 1: Create Test
  - Test Name: "Comprehensive Assessment 2024"
  - Test Type: "Assessment" → Subject field disappears
  - Description: "Full assessment covering multiple topics"

Step 2: Multi-Section Panel Appears (automatically)

Step 3: Add Section 1
  - Section Name: "Verbal Ability"
  - Duration: 30 minutes
  - Questions: 20
  - Marks per Question: 1

Step 4: Add Questions to Section 1
  - Add 20 verbal questions

Step 5: Add Section 2
  - Section Name: "Technical Skills"
  - Duration: 45 minutes
  - Questions: 30
  - Marks per Question: 2

Step 6: Add Questions to Section 2
  - Add 30 technical questions

Step 7: Submit
  - Total Duration: 75 minutes (30 + 45)
  - Total Questions: 50 (20 + 30)
  - Total Marks: 80 (20×1 + 30×2)
```

## Data Structure

### Practice Test (No Sections)
```json
{
  "testName": "JavaScript Practice",
  "testType": "Practice",
  "subject": "Technical",
  "hasSections": false,
  "numberOfQuestions": 20,
  "marksPerQuestion": 1,
  "duration": 30,
  "questions": [...]
}
```

### Assessment Test (With Sections)
```json
{
  "testName": "Comprehensive Assessment",
  "testType": "Assessment",
  "subject": "Technical",
  "hasSections": true,
  "sections": [
    {
      "sectionName": "Verbal Ability",
      "sectionDuration": 30,
      "numberOfQuestions": 20,
      "marksPerQuestion": 1,
      "questions": [...]
    },
    {
      "sectionName": "Technical Skills",
      "sectionDuration": 45,
      "numberOfQuestions": 30,
      "marksPerQuestion": 2,
      "questions": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Frontend Validation
- Section name cannot be empty
- Each section must have at least 1 question
- Each section must have exactly the specified number of questions
- All questions must have text, 4 options, and correct answer

### Backend Validation
- Validates section structure completeness
- Ensures each section has correct question count
- Validates all question fields
- Auto-calculates total marks, questions, and duration from sections

## Features Preserved
- Practice tests work exactly as before (single section)
- Assignment test type maintains original functionality
- All existing validation rules remain active
- PDF/CSV/JSON upload still works
- Test editing preserves section structure

## Testing Verified
✅ Project builds successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Frontend validates correctly
✅ Backend accepts section data
✅ Practice tests unaffected
✅ Multi-section tests save correctly
